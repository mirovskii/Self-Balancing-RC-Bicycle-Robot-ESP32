# Self-Balancing-RC-Bicycle-Robot-ESP32
This project involves the design, construction, and control of a two-wheeled robotic bicycle that maintains its balance autonomously. The system utilizes an IMU sensor for tilt detection and a high-speed PID control loop to manage a steering servo for stabilization.
